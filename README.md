# Timeline

This repository contains the original static timeline site and a prototype rewrite using Vue.js located in the `vue-timeline` directory. The Vue version includes a small sample of events rendered as Vue components and can be run with Vite.

## Running the Vue demo

```bash
cd vue-timeline
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:5173`.
